This folder contains most of the code I needed for the 18086 project.  Not
included are files pertaining the PARTISN, which is restricted software.

The basic solvers are found in 
  sn_one_d.m  -- basic sweeps+PI in 1-D
  sn_two_d.m  -- basic sweeps+PI in 2-D
  S_1D.m      -- 1-D Gauss-Legendre quadrature set
  S_2D.m      -- 2-D level set method following Lewis and Miller, 1993

The matrix solvers are in
  sn_one_d_2g_matrix_vec.m  -- 1-D multigroup matrix formulation
  sn_two_d_matrix.m         -- 2-D " "

Input files are
  study_1d_***.m   -- the inputs for the various report studies
  sn2d2gtest.m     -- basic 2-D input for sweep+PI (generates 2-D
                       color plot in report)
  sn2dtest.m       -- simple verification for 2-D matrix and
                      gives a spy plot
